# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to insights delivery through interactive dashboards and presentations.
The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset, uncover key insights, and present them using SQL, Python, Power BI, and reporting tools in a business-friendly manner.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data relevant to business analysis (sales / customers / operations – depending on use case).

Data was loaded and processed using Python and stored in a relational database for querying.

The dataset was checked for:

Missing values

Duplicates

Inconsistent formats

Outliers

(Dataset source can be mentioned here if public, or “Internal/Practice Dataset” if not.)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Programming & Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Databases: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Data Visualization: Power BI

Reporting: Power BI Report

Presentation: Gamma (AI-based PPT creation)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps

Data Loading

Imported dataset into Python using Pandas.

Connected Python to SQL databases for data storage and querying.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data distributions and trends.

Identified missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

Created visualizations to understand patterns.

Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handled missing and duplicate records.

Standardized column names and data formats.

Created derived columns for analysis.

SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server.

Wrote SQL queries to:

Filter and aggregate data

Perform joins and subqueries
